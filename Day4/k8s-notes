K8s History 
=========
	Ø K8s was created by google in 2013 in Go
	Ø Initially k8s was not open source
	Ø But in 2014 google introduced k8s as open source project and donated to CNCF(cloud native computing foundation)


Kubectl:- it is a command line interface to talk with cluster

	1. Imperative style:- using commands creating resources is called imperative style(via cli)
	2. Declarative style:- using manifest files or yaml creating resources is called declarative style

Pod lifecycle 
===========

	1. Pending 
 ===========

	Ø Pod is accepted by the cluster but not yet scheduled to any node

	2. Scheduled 
  ===========
	Ø The pod has been assigned to a node

	3. Containercreating
  ==================

	Ø Containers are now being created:- pull (image, create,start)

	4. Running 
  ==========

	Ø All containers in the pod are up and running

	5. Succeeded
 =============

	Ø All containers have terminated successfully with exit code 

	6. Failed
 ========

	Ø One or more containers exited with error and the pod will not be restarted

	7. CrashLoopBackoff
 ==================

	Ø Your container keeps crashing and restarting reportedly 

Causes
======
	Ø Issue is with container image only
	Ø App bug
	Ø Invalid env/config
	Ø Port already in use
	Ø Database unreachable 

	8. Terminating 
 ==============

	Ø Pod is being gracefully shutdown

	9. ImagepullBackOff
  ==================

	Ø Pod is unable to pull the image from the registry 


Rolling updates 
=============

	Ø Rolling update is default deployment strategy 
	Ø It will update pods gradually 
	Ø It will ensure zero downtime of ur app


	Ø Instead of deleting old pods and creating new pods k8s replaces pods one by one without any zero down time 


Why rolling updates
=================

	Ø High availability 
	Ø Smooth transition to new version
	Ø Easy rollback if something goes wrong
